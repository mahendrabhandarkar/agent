Agentic RAG, Agent AI, AI
Agent -- Automation Workflows
Azure AI Foundary
Bot -> cloud -> low code -> power platforms -> PVA [Power Virtual Agents] --> Copilot Studio
TFS - VSTS -> VSTS Online -> Azure DevOps
Automate the things which are not possible earliers -- Less Human Intervations
Always an Orachaestration where human in loop
Service Now Incidients
SAP allows integrations with all agents.
A2A protocol 

MCP - Model Context Protocol -- USB for agents -- 
MCP Servers -- 
Github MCP Servers ---
Google Search MCP Servers ---

Agentic AI uses MCP protocol for implementation.
MCP we use JSON RBC
HTTP 
MCP has no JWT token but 


Agent AI for begineers -- on github -- 10 minute videos
Datastructure learning needed or not 

Model returns score which gives output. How we get scores in model.

How deepseek AI agent is differs in google gemini agent.? And what makes it supper useful.

contentstack -- CMS -- personalized recommendation.

Bring your own agents:
-----------------------
smolaagents, langchain, crewai, mastra -- stacks used for developing agents using python
Agents has tools
tools are code written somehere perform operations
Problem of Traceablity
Anthropic --- 
Why should developer focusing on maintaining the context, should model should define context
Model Context Protocol -- MCP --- Avoid DDOS attack and traceability
MCP Server tool -- write code which shows add mentioned that use calculator

from mcp import MCPServer
server = MCPServer()

server.tool("calculate")
def calculate(operation: str, a: float, b: float):operation=="add":
	return a+  b
	....
	
	
config file and connect it with LLM
MCP started to halucinate after 40 prompts
How you will manage when have multiple agent and MCP Server --- Solution: Orachaestration
Orchestrator was biasing itself to use some or other agent
why are we having static workflows
A2A (Agent to Agent Protocol)
A2A is all we have to take care of your agents. like similar MCP does for functions.
It helps for scalable, Monitoring and Reusable

RAGA framework --- RAGAs --- https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J3M95E0LQl8
noise sensitivity
context reletaivity

imaging simple arthimetic agent
Would you want to have LLM like chatgpt
When we create an agent, we have to specify what tasks it will work.

Ollama --- LLM is just piece of code
Best ways to optimize for context --- agentic AI --- 
IVEFEQ (IVF with PQ) vector index --- Hierarchical Navigational Small world [HNSW]. https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=chz74Mtd1AA
IN Agent we have relevance, these rules are used to define. In agent we have LLM. MCP and A2A both has LLM.

Agent has caching memory.
KVCache -- Knowledge World Cache --- https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jk2FsJxZFo8
threshold above 4 -- it gives same answer.

How to implement privacy of data --- 
Knowledge Graph --- We can use Knowledge Graph -- chunk to data connected to another chunk. Neo4J, etc

mcp_a2a_attempt_1
python contextstack.py

pip
uv -- package written in rust -- to install python dependency --- https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JeiCxJP7IK4

Agent card --- extracted by A2A. We need to add it in A2A interface.

Short Memory and Long Memory Concepts in A2A --- https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6qXcIaSS-kg

fallback mechanism in A2A [Agent to Agent Protocol] -- https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LUpe9SFocng&t=148s

We have jail break prompt. It will not consider harmful things like delete, etc.

LLM, Prompt -- Problem start when we have asked questions about out of context data.

RAG -- Used for my organization with LLM

Vector database and Embeeding Model

Typical AI Application with Current AI Applications

MCP - Standardizes how LLM interact with different tools, database, etc

General Archtecture 
MCP Client CI.

Core Concepts
- MCP Hosts - Program like Claude Desktop, Visual Studio Code, IDEs or AI tools that want to access data through MCP.
- MCP CLients -- Protol client that maintain 1:1 connections with servers.
- MCP Servers -- lightweight programs that each expose specific capabilities through the standardized MCP.

Short Term Memory -- 
Long Term Memory -- Vector database

First discovery MCP and do this task then it will send request to capaibility it has and will get response.

https://github.com/modelcontextprotocol/servers.git

https://github.com/modelcontextprotocol/java-sdk

It will search both servers and return the result. We will decide response based on workflow.

goibobo --- uses MCP architecure. 

Claude Desktop Version ----- https://claude.ai/download

Zerodha MCP Server -- https://zerodha.com/z-connect/featured/connect-your-zerodha-account-to-ai-assistants-with-kite-mcp
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dA6IgCdg6tE

Content Safety featured -- define temperature and check threat
Create System prompt which gives response for questions related to your organization.

File System MCP Server ---
LLM - to save token cost its implement caching system -- Caching layer to reduce the cost.

Swipe Coding -- 

SBC Server -- Session Border Controller (SBC) is a network element that sits at the edge of a network, primarily used in VoIP and unified communications (UC) environments. It acts as a security gateway, mediating communication between different networks and ensuring secure, reliable, and high-quality voice and video sessions.
------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Best practices -- Giving the data lack, Locally build MCP server ---  


AI model for unstructured data --- Like Videos, Image, etc.

Claude Desktop - Is used for MCP servers to test. ---- 

How our data will be safe --- Twilio Calling server [it uses Auth0], Some uses API Key [Key, Value] pair.
Mult-Factor Authentication.

As we are building MCP server on local so no need to develop authentication.

LM Studio --- alternative of ollama tool. We can use it to run model locally. --- https://lmstudio.ai/

Open Router - give you capabilities to connect multiple model at a time. --- https://openrouter.ai/

opencv/opencv: Open Source Computer Vision Library

Build agents in Copilot Studio for Insurance

Journey to the Frontier Firm
-------------------------------
Retrieval --- Information --- 
Perform Task --- Tasks and action
Autonomous --- Approve or Reject Agent

Policy Issuance -- can be easily done by automation.
Claims Traiging - JIRA Tasks --- All checks are passed but human is approved. Human can just review.

Transformng Enterprise Business Processes with MCS -- Github Copilot
Invoice Processing Agents
HR Agent
Sales Agent --- CRM Microsoft Dynamics -- Copilot --- Linked it about Teams

Spectrum of Agents

A2A protocol -- Team of agents to do specific tasks

Why Copilot Studio for Insurance
---------------------------------
1. Reduce Support load 
	- Streamline clain handling
	- Asnwers policy questions 24*7
	- Reduce
	
Retreval Agent
Task Based Agent

Copilot Studio
--- We have 2 agent
	--- Claim Insurer --- 
	--- Policy Agent --- 
	--- Multi-Agent 
	
Low Code no code platforms

Agent Orchastration --- Multiple agent and autonomous agent

Responsible AI Principle:
Content Moderaion Level: 

Multi-Model is used for Image, Video and Text processing.

text embedding model --- Unstructured, blog data, etc.

Agent Architects
-----------------
What would be the first thing you'd teach a newly-created AI if you had the chance?

Agent Architects:
Building Smarter Brains, One Demo at the time.

What is an Agent?
A piece of code that is able to executes 1 or more defined tasks

Language Model -- Travel is the only thing that buy, that makes you richer.

Single Agent					Multi Agent
- LLM call						-
- tools							-
-- Tool call					-

langchain lamda ---- for AWS

Langchain vs LIamaIndex vs Swarm - Which is best and which will cost less? --- https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IPLh11OvftE --- https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RK5rRR78fSA

Routing / Supervisor --- Everything will be focus on agent itself.
