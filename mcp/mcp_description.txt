MCP Stands for Model Context Protocol
Protocol: The rules for communication
Model: Refers to AI models (e.g. GPT, Gemini)
Context: The Subject or background information of something you give the LLM model - inputs
Parts of MCP [Request --> MCP Host ---> LLM ---> MCP Client ---> MCP Server ]
- Hosts --- example: VSCode --- LLM Modx  -- It has capabilty of hosting LLM Model.
- Clients -- example: CO-pilot studio -- MCP client request to expose model data to MCP Server. MCP Client will get request of user.
- Servers -- example: Dynamics 365 --- It exposes the available tools. Tools means API or any logic. MCP server expose you model data.
MCP Core Primitives
-- Tools @mcp.tool
-- Resources  @mcp.resource
-- Prompts @mcp.prompt
Architecture of Model Customization Platform (MCP):
- Tools → Functions your model can call
- Resources → External data/models exposed for context
- Prompt Templates → UX-friendly templates for consistent prompting
TRANSPORT MECHANISMS of MCP:
- STDIO
- Streamable HTTP (SSE - Server Sentiments)
Semantic Kernel (SK) is an open-source SDK by Microsoft that helps developers integrate AI models (like OpenAI’s GPT) into traditional applications using plugins, memory, and planner systems.
