Waves of Disruption -- Cyber Security analytics DNS

Neo4J --- Graph Database

What is good for
What is not food for

Live telemetry of ships

Its started by IIT bombay boy. Its not usesful for timeseries stuff.
Not good for chronological data.

How to query the data ---- Track relationships of entities. What time of certain event happens.
For unstructured data we should use Neo4J. Hybrid databases is also great when you can store relationship.

Graph data structure

Bind DNS Server -- opensource
Beakning -- concept of malware
Cypher Query

Integration framework AI -- langchain, etc  -- GraphTrail
VertexAI ---
GenAI

Data Architect

Dependencies is the thing of past.

Language model --- 

Peaces tool -- for large chunk data. find context chatgpt, etc. based data. find context.

flutter --- MVMB 

System design round -- giving actual problem and getting it resolved. And constraints in it. Upstox.

exclidraw for diagram creation -- prototpe, architectural diagram. Calidraw - exclidraw for diagram creation. mermaid live editor. AI bot generate scaffolding.

RAG --- for latest data --- database [NLP]. Document based RAG. Vector database. Extending model capability by adding RAG and Vector database.
CodeAssist tool. Index project file -- In-person AI.

deepseekR1 deploy on local machine. Ollama on VPS. 1 GB. What is meaning of R1.

Chain of thoughts train --- Learn about it.

floating point set -- its important aspect in model.

visualize data in 3d library.

Domain , Malicious categories.

Neo4J albine tool for large data insertion.

Decisions on Schema --- Asking how to query it.

How to check dns request raised on DNS.  Chromium --- has feature to see what it sent on dns.

Movies Recommendation chatbot using vertex AI.

Create Knowledge data of AI -- by Neo4J

console.neo4j.io

Ask Recommend by some sci-fi movie - I want to watch a sci-fi movie 
-- Recommend me a romantic comedy with a happy ending with actor as SRK
-- I'm in the mood for something romantic

-- Generate vector embeddings on movie overview/ploys using text-embeddings from vertex AI
-- build a gradio chatbot using gemeini and deploy on hugging face spaces o google cloud run.

Neo4j fundamentals

Graph theory

Nodes can be identified by
Relations connect two nodes
Relations has direction

The O(n) problem -- of relation database.

Do you struggle with complex database schemas?
Do you store hierarchical data.
Analysze connection between data.
Graph databases are designed to efficiently 

Cypher codes -- MATCH 

Cypher is GQL [Graph Query Language]. Declarative language that allows you to identify patterns in your data using an ASCII-art style syntax consisting of brackets, dashes and arrows.

POlygraph -- Polygot

Encode the relationship between different datasets

Graph database is not picked up. It's not that easy for work for organization
Diffcult to adopt
Amazon Naptune, RangoDB, 
RelationShip are structured

Multi-modal data is not easily stored in relationship and entity
Node has properties
