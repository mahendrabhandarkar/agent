Model Creation Steps
----------------------
Input - photo
Output - name of plant

For Image We need to use CNN Model:
1. chatgpt code "cnn code to for plant image"
2. change parameter code
3. Model training (available in code)
4. Store vector in Neo4J database - layers.Flatten() -- will give vector
5. Dense -- Layer of neural network (no action needed)
6. Inference Model on new images, allowing it to classify or detect objects based on learned features without further adjustment of weights.
